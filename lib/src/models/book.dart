          desc: "In her debut book, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Andrea Elliott tells the harrowing story of a girl’s coming-of-age against the backdrop of the homeless crisis in New York City. Invisible Child traces almost a decade of Dasani Coates’ life, beginning in 2012 when she lived in a Brooklyn shelter at 11 years old. As she grows older, Dasani is forced to decide whether to keep her family intact or attend boarding school and leave them behind. Through following her journey, Elliott crafts an intimate exploration of poverty and racism in the U.S., as well as a portrait of a young person’s resilience."
